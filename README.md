### 24.3.2016

Initial release. Starting with Tsai David's boilerplate (https://github.com/tsaiDavid/simple-redux-boilerplate).

Lot's of changes tho. First commit can be used as an boilerplate from me ;) All credits to Tsai for great work!

List what needs to be done:

- Bundle Semantic & Jquery properly. Now a bit hacky, but works. (very low priority)
-

- Added Semantic-UI "properly"
- Added Header.js with semantic properties
- Overall linting fixes
